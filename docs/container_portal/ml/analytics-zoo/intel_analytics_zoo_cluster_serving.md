## Description

Analytics Zoo Cluster Serving is a lightweight distributed, real-time serving solution that supports a wide range of deep learning models (such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe, BigDL and OpenVINO models). 

It provides a simple pub/sub API, so that the users can easily send their inference requests to the input queue (using a simple Python API); Cluster Serving will then automatically manage the scale-out and real-time model inference across a large cluster (using distributed streaming frameworks such as Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, etc.)
