## Description

Intel® Optimizations for TensorFlow\* with Jupyter Notebook is a binary distribution of TensorFlow\* with Intel® oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library(Intel® oneDNN) primitives, a popular performance library for deep learning applications. TensorFlow\* is a widely-used machine learning framework in the deep learning arena, demanding efficient utilization of computational resources. In order to take full advantage of Intel® architecture and to extract maximum performance, the TensorFlow\* framework has been optimized using Intel® oneDNN primitives.

Includes the Python3 interpreter and the following wheel(s) and librarie(s) are pre-installed:
 - [intel-tensorflow](https://pypi.org/project/intel-tensorflow)
 - [Jupyter](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/)
 - [Notebook](https://pypi.org/project/notebook/)
