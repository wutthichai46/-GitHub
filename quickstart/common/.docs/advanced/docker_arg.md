<!-- 55. Docker arg -->
Any of the `launch_benchmark.py` commands below can be run on bare metal by
removing the `--docker-image` arg. Ensure that you have all of the
[required prerequisites installed](README.md#run-the-model) in your environment
before running without the docker container.

If you are new to docker and are running into issues with the container,
see [this document](/docs/general/docker.md) for troubleshooting tips.
