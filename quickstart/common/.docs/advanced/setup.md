Prior to using these instructions, please follow the setup instructions from
the model's [README](README.md) and/or the
[AI Kit documentation](/docs/general/tensorflow/AIKit.md) to get your environment
setup (if running on bare metal) and download the dataset, pretrained model, etc.
If you are using AI Kit, please exclude the `--docker-image` flag from the
commands below, since you will be running the the TensorFlow conda environment
instead of docker.
