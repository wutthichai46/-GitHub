## Quick Start Scripts

| Script name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| [`fp32_training_check_accuracy.sh`](fp32_training_check_accuracy.sh) | Trains the model for a specified number of steps (default is 500) and then compare the accuracy against the specified target accuracy. If the accuracy is not met, then script exits with error code 1. The `CHECKPOINT_DIR` environment variable can optionally be defined to start training based on previous set of checkpoints. |
| [`fp32_training.sh`](fp32_training.sh) | Trains the model for 10 epochs. The `CHECKPOINT_DIR` environment variable can optionally be defined to start training based on previous set of checkpoints. |
| [`fp32_training_demo.sh`](fp32_training_demo.sh) | A short demo run that trains the model for 100 steps. |

These quickstart scripts can be run in different environments:
* [Bare Metal](#bare-metal)
* [Docker](#docker)
