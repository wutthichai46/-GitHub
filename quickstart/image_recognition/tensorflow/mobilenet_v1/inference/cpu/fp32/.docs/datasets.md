## Datasets

This step is required only for running accuracy, for running benchmark we do not need to provide dataset.

Download and preprocess the ImageNet dataset using the [instructions here](/datasets/imagenet/README.md).
After running the conversion script you should have a directory with the ImageNet dataset in the TF records format.

Set the `DATASET_DIR` to point to this directory when running <model name>.
