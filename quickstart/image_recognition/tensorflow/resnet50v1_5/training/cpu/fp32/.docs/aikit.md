## Run the model

Setup your environment using the instructions below, depending on if you are
using [AI Kit](/docs/general/tensorflow/AIKit.md):

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Setup using AI Kit</th>
    <th>Setup without AI Kit</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>To run using AI Kit you will need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>numactl
        <li>openmpi-bin (only required for multi-instance)
        <li>openmpi-common (only required for multi-instance)
        <li>openssh-client (only required for multi-instance)
        <li>openssh-server (only required for multi-instance)
        <li>libopenmpi-dev (only required for multi-instance)
        <li>horovod==0.21.0 (only required for multi-instance)
        <li>Activate the tensorflow conda environment
        <pre>conda activate tensorflow</pre>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>To run without AI Kit you will need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Python 3
        <li>[intel-tensorflow>=2.5.0](https://pypi.org/project/intel-tensorflow/)
        <li>git
        <li>numactl
        <li>openmpi-bin (only required for multi-instance)
        <li>openmpi-common (only required for multi-instance)
        <li>openssh-client (only required for multi-instance)
        <li>openssh-server (only required for multi-instance)
        <li>libopenmpi-dev (only required for multi-instance)
        <li>horovod==0.21.0 (only required for multi-instance)
        <li>A clone of the Model Zoo repo<br />
        <pre>git clone https://github.com/IntelAI/models.git</pre>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

After finishing the setup above, set environment variables for the path to your 
`DATASET_DIR` for ImageNet and an `OUTPUT_DIR` where log files and checkpoints will be written. 
Navigate to your model zoo directory and then run a [quickstart script](#quick-start-scripts).
```
# cd to your model zoo directory
cd models

export DATASET_DIR=<path to the ImageNet TF records>
export OUTPUT_DIR=<directory where log files and checkpoints will be written>

./quickstart/image_recognition/tensorflow/resnet50v1_5/training/cpu/fp32/<script name>.sh
```
